# In order to maintain an authenticated session with logind 
# and to prevent bypassing the screen locker by switching terminals, 
# Xorg has to be started on the same virtual terminal where the login 
# occurred [1]. Therefore it is recommended to specify vt$XDG_VTNR 
# in the ~/.xserverrc file: 

exec /usr/bin/Xorg -nolisten tcp "$@" vt$XDG_VTNR
